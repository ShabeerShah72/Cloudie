# ☁️ Cloudie - Weather App

Cloudie is a simple weather application built using Flutter. It allows users to search for any city and view the current weather conditions and temperature in real-time.

## 🌟 About

This is my second Flutter project, created as part of my learning journey in mobile app development. I’m **Shabbir Sharma**, a beginner developer passionate about building user-friendly applications.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔍 City-based weather search
- 🌡️ Real-time temperature and condition updates
- 🌐 API integration for live weather data
- 🎨 Clean and minimal user interface

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Flutter** - UI framework
- **Dart** - Programming language
- **OpenWeatherMap API** (or similar) for weather data
- **HTTP package** for API calls

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The user enters a city name.
2. The app fetches weather data from the API using the API key.
3. The weather conditions and temperature are displayed on the screen.
